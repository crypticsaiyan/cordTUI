# Phosphor - Hackathon Presentation Script (3 Minutes)

## � RRESURRECTION CATEGORY - Built in 4 Days with Kiro

---

### [0:00 - 0:15] HOOK

"What if chatting with your team didn't need 2 gigabytes of RAM? 

We resurrected IRC - the protocol that connected millions in the 90s - and wrapped it in Discord's UX. Meet **Phosphor**: 20MB of RAM, sub-second startup, 100x more efficient.

Built entirely in **4 days using Kiro**. Let me show you."

---

### [0:15 - 0:45] USER-FRIENDLY NAVIGATION

*[Show the main UI]*

"First - the UI. It's designed to feel familiar but work anywhere.

**Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to move between sidebar, chat, and members. No mouse needed - perfect for terminal power users.

**Mouse Support**: But if you prefer clicking, everything is clickable too.

**Slash Commands**: Type a slash..."

*[Type `/` in the input box - show command palette appearing]*

"...and instantly see all available commands. `/send` for files, `/ai` for DevOps bot, `/join` for channels. Auto-complete as you type.

**Command Palette**: Press Ctrl+P for the full command palette - switch themes, take screenshots, adjust volume, all from keyboard."

---

### [0:45 - 1:10] CHANNELS & BOOKMARKS

*[Navigate to sidebar]*

"Channels work like Discord. Click to switch. See unread counts.

**Bookmarks**: Found a channel you love? Ctrl+B to bookmark it."

*[Show bookmark being added - star appears]*

"Bookmarked channels appear at the top with a star. Persists across sessions.

**Join New Channels**: Ctrl+J opens channel search. Browse or type to filter. One click to join."

*[Show channel search dialog]*

---

### [1:10 - 1:30] RETRO AUDIO - GEIGER COUNTER

*[Trigger some activity]*

"Now here's something unique - **audio feedback**.

Remember when computers beeped? When hard drives clicked? We brought that back.

New message? *[beep sound]* Retro notification.
DM received? *[different beep]* Distinct sound.
Errors in logs? The beeping intensifies - like a Geiger counter warning you before you even see the problem.

**Your computer talks to you again.**"

---

### [1:30 - 1:50] MEMBER LIST & DIRECT MESSAGES

*[Click on member list]*

"See all channel members on the right. Online status shown.

**Start a DM**: Just click any username..."

*[Click a member name]*

"...and you're in a private conversation. DMs appear in the sidebar under 'Direct Messages'. Unread indicators. Full history.

This is how modern chat should work - but in your terminal."

---

### [1:50 - 2:10] FILE TRANSFER - WORMHOLE MAGIC

*[In a DM conversation]*

"Need to send a file? No cloud uploads. No security risks.

Type `/send filename`..."

*[Type /send demo.txt]*

"...and Phosphor generates a human-readable code like '7-guitar-ocean'. 

The recipient types `/grab 7-guitar-ocean` - **peer-to-peer encrypted transfer**. No server in between. No traces. 

We resurrected IRC's DCC file transfer but made it actually secure and easy."

---

### [2:10 - 2:35] TELETEXT DASHBOARD & MCP

*[Press F1]*

"Press F1 and welcome to 1985. **Teletext** - those TV information pages your parents remember.

But this isn't nostalgia. This is a **live DevOps dashboard**:
- Real-time CPU and memory usage
- Network I/O stats  
- Process information
- Connection status

All rendered in authentic Ceefax style with block graphics.

**MCP Integration**: The `/ai` command connects to Docker, fetches container health, and gives you actionable insights - all through Model Context Protocol."

---

### [2:35 - 2:50] HALLOWEEN THEME - KIRO MAGIC

*[Open command palette, select Halloween theme]*

"And because it's the Resurrection Hackathon... 🎃

Watch this theme switch..."

*[Theme transforms to orange/purple Halloween]*

"**Kiro generated this entire Halloween theme** - 500+ lines of CSS, themed logos, spooky emojis throughout. I said 'make it Halloween' and Kiro delivered.

4 days. One AI assistant. A complete, polished product."

---

### [2:50 - 3:00] CLOSING

"**Phosphor**: Three dead technologies resurrected - IRC, Teletext, and audio feedback.

Discord's UX. Terminal's efficiency. Halloween's spirit.

Built in 4 days with Kiro. **The past isn't dead - it just needed better tools.**

Thank you."
